## The purpose of this project is to track COVID-19 data for the state of Iowa. Although the data that the state publishes daily is quite good, there is no permanancy. In this project, data is (generally) collected at 10 AM from https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/.
## You may use the data as you wish, but please cite this as your source.
